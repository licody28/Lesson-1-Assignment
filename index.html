      <p>Here's a group photo of some friends and I, where we volunteered with Washington Trails Association. <br>
        We spent <strong>6 hours</strong> helping WTA clear up and repair some hiking trails. <br>
        A lot of manual labor that included removing stumps, removing weeds, tilling the dirt, and more.</p>
